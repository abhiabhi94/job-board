You will set the vision for how goods flow from suppliers to customers in a seamless, automated way.\n\n\u25cf\tArchitect and Implement Systems from Scratch: Evaluate, select, and deploy the core platforms (ERP, OMS, WMS, and other key systems) that will form our supply chain backbone. Design the integrations between these systems to ensure real-time data flow and a single source of truth across our supply chain.\n\n\u25cf\tDrive Automation &amp; Innovation: Identify opportunities to automate and optimize every step of the supply chain. This includes implementing warehouse automation (robotics, conveyor systems, IoT sensors), order processing automation (workflow engines, RPA), and data-driven tools (AI/ML for demand forecasting, inventory optimization, route planning). You\u2019ll pilot and integrate cutting-edge technologies to improve efficiency, accuracy, and speed.\n\n\u25cf\tLead End-to-End Project Delivery: Oversee the full lifecycle of system implementation projects \u2013 from requirements gathering and solution design to vendor management, testing, and go-live. You will ensure projects are delivered on time and within budget, managing risks and stakeholder expectations along the way.\n\n\u25cf\tCollaborate Cross-Functionally: Work closely with internal teams to align system capabilities with business needs. Ensure that process design and system configuration support operational workflows and scalability for LOADE and future brands.\n\n\u25cf\tBuild and Mentor a High-Performing Team: Hire and lead a team of system analysts, solution architects, and project managers (as needed) to support the implementation and ongoing management of supply chain systems. Foster a culture of innovation, ownership, and continuous improvement within the team.\n\n\u25cf\tManage External Partners: Engage and coordinate with external technology vendors, consultants, and integration partners. You will negotiate contracts, define scopes, and oversee partners during ERP/OMS/WMS implementations or when deploying automation solutions in warehouses.\n\n\u25cf\tEnsure Scalability, Security &amp; Reliability: Establish governance for system maintenance, upgrades, and data integrity. Implement robust processes for monitoring performance, security, and data quality across all supply chain systems. Ensure the architecture is scalable and flexible to support rapid growth and new business models or brand launches.\n\n\u25cf\tChampion Continuous Improvement: Once systems are live, continually analyze supply chain performance data to identify bottlenecks or enhancement opportunities. Drive iterative improvements and new feature rollouts to keep our supply chain capabilities best-in-class.\n\n\u25cf\tStrategic Leadership: Act as the supply chain technology thought leader at The Lumia Group. Stay abreast of industry trends and emerging technologies, and advise the executive team on how to leverage them. Your insights will help shape not just our technology, but also our overall supply chain strategy and innovation roadmap.\n\nWho You Are\n\u25cf\tSeasoned Supply Chain Technology Expert: You have extensive experience (10+ years) in designing and implementing supply chain systems in a retail, e-commerce, or FMCG environment. Your background might include roles such as Senior Solutions Architect, Technical Architect, or Product Owner focused on supply chain and logistics.\n\n\u25cf\tEnd-to-End Systems Knowledge: Deep understanding of supply chain execution processes and the software that powers them \u2013 including ERP (enterprise resource planning for procurement, finance, inventory), OMS (order management systems for sales channels and fulfillment), WMS (warehouse management systems for distribution centers), and ideally TMS (transportation management for logistics). You know how these systems integrate and have led implementations or major enhancements for them.\n\n\u25cf\tAutomation &amp; Innovation Mindset: Passionate about leveraging technology to streamline operations. You stay up-to-date on emerging supply chain tech \u2013 from warehouse robotics and IoT tracking devices to AI-driven forecasting and decision support. You have a track record of introducing automation (software or hardware) to eliminate manual work and improve accuracy.\n\n\u25cf\tStrategic Thinker and Hands-On Builder: You can craft a big-picture architecture and long-term plan, but you\u2019re equally comfortable rolling up your sleeves to solve technical problems or configure a system. You excel at breaking down ambitious goals into actionable plans. In prior projects, you\u2019ve taken ideas from concept to reality in lean, fast-paced environments.\n\n\u25cf\tLeadership &amp; Team Collaboration: An inspiring leader and team player. You have experience leading cross-functional initiatives and perhaps managing a small team or mentoring others. You communicate clearly, listen to diverse viewpoints, and build consensus to drive projects forward. Working closely with operations managers, engineers, and executives comes naturally to you.\n\n\u25cf\tEntrepreneurial Drive: Thrives in a build-from-scratch setting. Ambiguity or a blank canvas doesn\u2019t intimidate you \u2013 it energizes you. You are proactive, resourceful, and resilient, able to adapt as requirements evolve. Your mindset is geared toward growth and figuring out what\u2019s needed to achieve it.\n\n\u25cf\tCustomer-Focused &amp; Results-Oriented: You always consider the end customer and business impact in every system or process design. You set high standards for yourself and others, measuring success by tangible improvements in service levels, speed, and cost efficiency.\n\n\u25cf\tExcellent Communicator: Able to translate between business and tech. Whether it\u2019s pitching a vision to the C-suite, training front-line staff on a new tool, or negotiating with a software vendor, you communicate effectively and confidently at all levels.\n\n\u25cf\tBackground &amp; Education: A Bachelor\u2019s or Master\u2019s in Engineering, Computer Science, Supply Chain Management or related field is preferred. Professional certifications in project management or supply chain (e.g. PMP, CSCP) are a plus. More importantly, your experience and mindset set you apart. \n\nWhy Join Us\n\u25cf\tMake a Lasting Impact: Build something big from the ground up.
