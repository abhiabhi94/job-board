Sarah communicates with small business loan applicants via email or sms, guides them through the application process and prepares the loan file for a human underwriter.\r\n\r\n# Helping Small Businesses\r\n\r\nSmall businesses are the heart of the American economy and a lot of banks shy away from providing funding because of the manual effort in pursuing those deals. With us, that changes and unlocks affordable, quick bank funding for the 30M+ small businesses in the US as opposed to the high interest rates from predatory online lenders.\r\n\r\nAs an Senior Software Engineer, you will see your work repeatedly shipped to automate 1000s of real world conversations, helping small businesses get affordable funding.\r\n\r\n# All-Stanford Founding Team\r\n\r\n* Lukas (Stanford MBA), grew a banking software company to $150M+ ARR & 400+ employees.\r\n* Isaiah (Stanford CS), build a conversational AI platform to handle 20M+ conversations each year @ a Series D startup ($1B+ valuation).\r\n\r\n# Our Culture\r\n\r\n* Ownership: We take responsibility and do not assign blame. Building great software is hard and when something is broken, we ask ourselves \"How can I fix it?\"\r\n* Competition & Excellence: We are a fun group of former competitive athletes and gamers. We like to win and we know that the only thing between us and the title is our own ability to improve every day.\r\n\r\n# What you'll do:\r\n\r\n* Contribute rapidly to our software platform that automates the lending process and helps our customers operate their banks more efficiently\r\n* Develop and own new features that increase value for our customers\r\n* Propose meaningful improvements to our software architecture and design patterns\r\n* Learn and drive engineering best practices\r\n* Leverage automating testing and continuous integration / continuous delivery in order to rapidly iterate on our product\r\n\r\n# What you'll bring:\r\n\r\n* 4+ years of experience in software engineering, with a strong focus on front-end and full-stack development - machine learning, AI and natural language processing is a plus\r\n* Proven track record of planning and executing significant projects with long-term impacts\r\n* Solid understanding of modern programming languages and frameworks (e.g., React, TypeScript, Next.js, Python, etc.)\r\n* Experience with database technologies (Postgres) and cloud platforms (AWS)\r\n* Strong problem-solving skills and a knack for innovative thinking\r\n* Excellent communication skills and a collaborative team spirit",

                    "description": "We\u2019re looking for a Head of Engineering to take Pump from a scrappy, high-performing team to a world-class engineering org. We\u2019ve gone from $0 to $XXM+ ARR in under two years with a lean team of just 9 engineers, and now we need the right leader to help us scale to $XXXM+ ARR and beyond.\r\n\r\nOur mission is to automate cloud cost optimization with AI, making human-driven cloud consulting obsolete. Our customers save \\~60% on AWS and GCP costs instantly, and Azure. We\u2019re growing fast, competing (and winning) against well-funded incumbents, and have built a business that scales efficiently without bloated sales teams or overpriced consultants.\r\n\r\n### **Why this role**\r\n\r\n* Build from the ground up \u2013 The foundation is strong, but there\u2019s a lot of room to shape the team, culture, and tech.\r\n* High ownership, high impact \u2013 Engineering at Pump isn\u2019t a cost center; it\u2019s the product. The decisions you make will directly impact our growth.\r\n* AI-first company \u2013 We\u2019re not bolting on AI; we\u2019re built around it. Our technical challenges aren\u2019t trivial, and we\u2019re solving real problems with real automation.\r\n* No legacy baggage \u2013 We move fast and iterate. You won\u2019t be stuck rewriting decade-old tech debt.\r\n\r\n### **What you\u2019ll do**\r\n\r\n* Scale the team from 9 to 30+ engineers, ensuring we hire fast while keeping the quality bar high.\r\n* Drive technical strategy and own the architecture, scalability, and reliability of our AI-driven cloud optimization platform.\r\n* Lead by example. This isn\u2019t just a people-management role. We want someone hands-on initially who can set the technical bar before transitioning into more leadership as we scale.\r\n* Mentor and develop talent while fostering a high-performance, ownership-driven culture.\r\n* Build a product engineers love. Our customers are technical (DevOps, engineers, CTOs), so the UX and API experience need to be best-in-class.\r\n\r\n### **Who you are**\r\n\r\n* 9-15 years of experience (graduated 2010-2015), with experience leading 15+ engineers.\r\n* Have built and scaled teams before\u2014ideally, you\u2019ve led engineering at a $30M+ ARR startup or scaled a team from Series A to Series C.\r\n* Still hands-on (for now). You don\u2019t need to be coding daily, but you should be comfortable rolling up your sleeves when needed.\r\n* Deep backend and infrastructure experience. You\u2019ve built and scaled products used by 1,000+ customers (not just internal tools).\r\n* AI-curious. You don\u2019t need to be an ML expert, but you should be excited about AI-driven automation.\r\n* Cloud-savvy. You have deep knowledge of AWS, GCP, and Azure.\r\n* Data-driven leader. You make decisions based on metrics, not just gut feel.\r\n* High execution, low ego. We value merit over politics. If you need fancy titles and layers of process, this won\u2019t be a fit.\r\n\r\n### **Why Pump**\r\n\r\n* $XXM+ ARR and growing fast. We\u2019re not in survival mode; we\u2019re scaling efficiently.\r\n* Lean, high-impact team. No layers of bureaucracy\u2014your work moves the needle.\r\n* Ownership and autonomy. You\u2019ll have real decision-making power.\r\n* Competitive comp and meaningful equity. We want you to share in the upside.\r\n* No BS culture. We\u2019re direct, we move fast, and we don\u2019t do politics.\r\n\r\nThis is a rare opportunity to build something big with a team that executes. If this sounds like your kind of challenge, we\u2019d love to chat.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s build.",

We're already accelerating engineering teams at some of the fastest-growing companies in the world - including Quora, Retool, Podium, Chegg, Runway, and more.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re currently a team of six, looking to hire another founding software engineer to keep up with the demand for new features. You\u2019ll work across the tech stack, taking ownership of features from end to end. As a founding engineer, you\u2019ll have significant influence over the direction of the company, and your work will directly impact our largest customers. You should expect this role to be very cross-functional - you\u2019ll ship code, work closely with customers (you could even own an account if you want), write documentation and marketing materials, solve support cases, and most likely do other unexpected things. If the prospect of working in a high-ambiguity environment at an early-stage startup excites you, and you are passionate about building products that delight users, we would love to hear from you.\r\n\r\n**As a founding engineer at Momentic, you will**\r\n\r\n* Own the entire technical stack, from our foundational AI layer to the customer-facing web app. We\u2019ll do our best to align your areas of focus with your skillset and interests.\r\n* Speak with customers regularly to hear their feedback and support them.\r\n* Be involved in roadmap prioritization and sequencing of our deliverables.\r\n* Document everything as you go, and share knowledge with the team.\r\n\r\n**Some examples of projects that we\u2019re shipping**\r\n\r\n* AI test generation and auto-healing to stay up to date with plain-text test specs.\r\n* Customizable and AI-powered network request mocking to accelerate frontend testing.\r\n* A new, Notion-like editor to make creating tests in Momentic a delightful experience.\r\n\r\n**To succeed in this role, you\u2019ll need to**\r\n\r\n* Be product-focused. You have customer empathy, and the things you build always keep the end user in mind. Your work will have an immediate impact on the overall user experience of Momentic, and this is something that you care about deeply.\r\n* Enjoy solving hard problems that have both product and technical ambiguity. The software testing space is plagued by inconsistencies and fragmented stacks. You\u2019ll need to be able to immerse yourself in unfamiliar topics and understand complex technical concepts to make informed decisions.\r\n* Have a high sense of agency and accountability and can prioritize your work without much outside input.\r\n* Be based in San Francisco and able to work regularly from our brand new SoMa office.\r\n* Have practical experience building products powered by LLMs.\r\n* Have great written and verbal communication.\r\n* Be interested in AI and software testing tools.\r\n* Experience using React and NextJS.\r\n\r\n**None of these things are required, but they\u2019ll make your application stand out**\r\n\r\n* Experience building CI, testing, or other developer tools.\r\n* Experience working with browser internals.\r\n* Other experience that makes you particularly knowledgeable about the deep, dark, undocumented corners of the web.\r\n\r\n**Our benefits include**\r\n\r\n* Attractive cash and equity compensation.\r\n* Generous medical, dental, and vision benefits.\r\n* 401(k) retirement plan.\r\n* Paid company holidays, sick time, and unlimited time off.\r\n* Monthly credits to spend on commuting to and from our SoMa office.\r\n* Rotating selection of snacks and beverages in our office.\r\n* Daily lunch at a variety of restaurants in the SoMa area.",

Since our founding in 2019, we\u2019ve scaled our platform to serve thousands of clients ranging from city council seats to US Senate races, and have helped them collectively manage over $10B in contributions.\r\n\r\nOur platform is an all-in-one system comprised of a donor CRM, a broadcast email/text tool, and payment processing pages that our clients rely on for their work every day. As our product is _the_ platform that our users operate out of every day, this also means that when we build and launch new products, we do so to all of our users, at scale \ud83d\ude80.\r\n\r\n**We\u2019ve experienced tremendous growth over the past 18 months** and are hiring an experienced engineer to help us scale our backend infrastructure and to support the development of several new products on our roadmap. In joining our small but mighty team of 6, you will help shape our team\u2019s culture and have a substantial impact on the success of our company \ud83d\udcc8 \u2014 come join us!\r\n\r\n### Who we\u2019re looking for\r\n\r\nWe are looking for an experienced engineer with the following skills / qualifications:\r\n\r\n* A minimum of 6+ years of professional software engineering experience. Leveling and salary will be commensurate with experience.\r\n* Strong understanding of SQL/relational databases and experience with data modeling.\r\n* Prior experience building web applications and scaling large-scale distributed systems.\r\n* Excellent written and verbal communication skills and high EQ.\r\n* Excitement to build brand new products (0\u21921) as well as to maintain, improve, and scale our existing product lines.\r\n* Some prior experience with our stack is nice to have, but a desire to work with the languages and tech we use (Ruby, GraphQL, TypeScript) is required.\r\n* You are located in the continental USA (ET, CT, MT, PT) and are willing to travel 1-2x a year for company retreats and/or team offsites (usually held in California).\r\n\r\n### What we\u2019re working on\r\n\r\nEvery feature of Numero is built with best-in-class engineering + design that we develop in close coordination with our clients. As a small team, we rotate working between each of our different product lines, so you\u2019ll have exposure to wide array of projects in this role.\r\n\r\nHere are some projects that we\u2019re currently working on:\r\n\r\n* **VoIP Capabilities:** Building features to enable clients to make phone calls and send text messages directly within our platform using a leased or personal number. Automatically transcribe calls and add relevant notes to contacts in the CRM.\r\n* **Task System + Workflow Engine:** Designing a modern task manager from the ground up \u2014 with rules-based workflow engines to help clients\u2019 automate their work within our CRM.\r\n* **AI Automations:** Developing AI automations to help our clients work faster and easier across a range of their work \u2014 including content generation, task / workflow automation, and general data hygiene (e.g. merging duplicates, appending missing data, etc).\r\n* **Tandem Fundraising:** Creating a system that lets clients split contributions from payment processing pages between multiple recipients, with careful and precise handling for fees, compliance reporting, refunds, and other edge cases.\r\n* **Integrations + Webhooks:** Enabling a two-way sync of our data with various tools that our clients use \u2014 both through direct integrations and realtime webhooks. This is more important as we are becoming the system of record for our clients' fundraising data.\r\n* **Custom Fields:** Architecting a system allowing clients to create custom fields to store and query different types of data in their CRM. Add support for configuring data types and enforcing format validations. Enable performant querying of this data via NumeroQL.\r\n* **Scaling NumeroQL:** Optimizing our custom-built query language (NQL) that receives millions of daily requests from our various frontends. Improve query performance and enhance it\u2019s ability to filter billions of records across multiple databases in realtime.\r\n\r\n### What we value\r\n\r\nHere are some of the concepts that we value as a team and hope resonate for you:\r\n\r\n* **Consistent + Clear.** You have seen how prioritizing consistency and clarity in a large code base increases productivity, shared understanding, and velocity on small teams.\r\n* **Eager, excited learners.** You are able to jump into different parts of the stack to develop (or debug), and are happy to pair with others to trade learnings + brainstorm solutions.\r\n* **Shipping-first orientation.** You have a bias toward action and are interested in building the right solution that solves a customer\u2019s needs without sacrificing quality or resiliency.\r\n* **Clear, thoughtful communication.** You value collaboration and are happy to share your thoughts and ideas directly with team mates in both writing and on calls.\r\n* **Follow Through, Hygiene.** You both enjoy completing your work, but also cleaning up tech debt along the way and leaving the codebase in a better state over time.\r\n\r\n### Tech Stack\r\n\r\nOur platform is built with a Ruby/Rails backend that serves data to several TypeScript/React frontends using a GraphQL API. We use Postgres as our primary database, but also store and serve some data from MongoDB and OpenSearch for specific use cases.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of some of the technologies you can expect to work with:\r\n\r\n* **Backend:** Ruby, Rails, Ruby GraphQL, Sidekiq, RSpec\r\n* **Frontend:** TypeScript, React, NextJS, Apollo GraphQL, Tailwind, Jest\r\n* **Database:** Postgres, MongoDB, OpenSearch, Redis\r\n* **Monitoring:** Sentry, PgAnalyze\r\n* **Hosting / CI:** Heroku, AWS, Vercel, Github Actions, Ubicloud\r\n\r\nDepending on your experience, you may work more on one side of the stack than the other, but as a small team that values learning and growth, there will be projects that may require you to work on parts of the stack that you\u2019re less familiar with (we hope this excites you)!\r\n\r\n### Compensation + Benefits\r\n\r\nFor this role, we offer a salary in the range of **$150,000 - $190,000** and equity. We also offer the following benefits to help you to do the best work of your career:\r\n\r\n* Flexible PTO (including 12 company holidays and 2 weeks of required PTO each year)\r\n* Medical, dental and vision coverage with HSA option; 50% coverage for dependents\r\n* Paid Parental Leave for primary and secondary caregivers\r\n* Your choice of premium tech setup \u2013\u00a0laptop, monitor, accessories, and headphones\r\n* $1,000 for your work-from-home setup\r\n* Stipend for co-working 1 day / week (e.g. WeWork)\r\n* Annual company retreat and/or team offsites",

Includes a database modeling exercise, a live coding exercise, and a paired code review.\r\n* **Final Interview with Cofounders:** A quick \\~30 minute chat with our other two cofounders to give you and and our founders a chance to ask questions.\r\n\r\nIf all goes well, the next step is extending an offer \ud83c\udf89!",

Since our founding in 2019, we\u2019ve scaled our platform to serve thousands of clients ranging from city council seats to US Senate races, and have helped them collectively manage over $10B in contributions.\r\n\r\nOur platform is an all-in-one system comprised of a donor CRM, a broadcast email/text tool, and payment processing pages that our clients rely on for their work every day. As our product is _the_ platform that our users operate out of every day, this also means that when we build and launch new products, we do so to all of our users, at scale \ud83d\ude80.\r\n\r\n**We\u2019ve experienced tremendous growth over the past 18 months** and are hiring an experienced engineer to help us scale our backend infrastructure and to support the development of several new products on our roadmap. In joining our small but mighty team of 6, you will help shape our team\u2019s culture and have a substantial impact on the success of our company \ud83d\udcc8 \u2014 come join us!\r\n\r\n### Who we\u2019re looking for\r\n\r\nWe are looking for an experienced engineer with the following skills / qualifications:\r\n\r\n* A minimum of 6+ years of professional software engineering experience. Leveling and salary will be commensurate with experience.\r\n* Strong understanding of modern frontend architecture, frameworks, and best practices.\r\n* Mastery of JavaScript (TypeScript preferred!), CSS3, and HTML5 and DOM / web APIs.\r\n* Excellent written and verbal communication skills and high EQ.\r\n* Excitement to build brand new products (0\u21921) as well as to maintain, improve, and scale our existing product lines.\r\n* Prior experience with our stack is nice to have, but a desire to work with the languages and tech we use (TypeScript, React, GraphQL) is required.\r\n* You are located in the continental USA (ET, CT, MT, PT) and are willing to travel 1-2x a year for company retreats and/or team offsites (usually held in California).\r\n\r\n### What we\u2019re working on\r\n\r\nEvery feature of Numero is built with best-in-class engineering + design that we develop in close coordination with our clients. As a small team, we rotate working between each of our different product lines, so you\u2019ll have exposure to wide array of projects in this role.\r\n\r\nHere are some projects that we\u2019re currently working on:\r\n\r\n* **Conversion Optimization:** Improving and optimizing donation conversion rates on our ultra-fast, accessible contribution and petition pages through advanced frontend caching, server-side rendering, and data-driven optimization strategies.\r\n* **VoIP Client:** Building a web and mobile UI that supports making realtime phone calls (e.g. WebRTC) and text messages with contacts to support our clients\u2019 daily donor outreach.\r\n* **Messages Inbox:** Developing a system to enable our clients to respond to inbound text and email messages so that they can operate a shared inbox as a team directly on our platform.\r\n* **Robust Report Visualizations:** Building high quality, modern data viz components including charts, tables, and funnel views either fully custom from scratch or using advanced libraries (Chart.js, Nivo, Visx, etc).\r\n* **Task System + Workflow UX:** Building a task manager UI \u2014 with rules-based workflow visualizations to help clients\u2019 automate their work within our CRM.\r\n* **Scaling Numero Component Library:** Abstracting and generalizing common component patterns across several different frontend client contexts for streamlined styling, behavior, and visual testing.\r\n\r\n### What we value\r\n\r\nHere are some of the concepts that we value as a team and hope resonate for you:\r\n\r\n* **Consistent + Clear.** You have seen how prioritizing consistency and clarity in a large code base increases productivity, shared understanding, and velocity on small teams.\r\n* **Eager, excited learners.** You are able to jump into different parts of the stack to develop (or debug), and are happy to pair with others to trade learnings + brainstorm solutions.\r\n* **Shipping-first orientation.** You have a bias toward action and are interested in building the right solution that solves a customer\u2019s needs without sacrificing quality or resiliency.\r\n* **Clear, thoughtful communication.** You value collaboration and are happy to share your thoughts and ideas directly with team mates in both writing and on calls.\r\n* **Follow Through, Hygiene.** You both enjoy completing your work, but also cleaning up tech debt along the way and leaving the codebase in a better state over time.\r\n\r\n### Tech Stack\r\n\r\nOur platform is built with a Ruby/Rails backend that serves data to several TypeScript/React frontends using a GraphQL API. We use Postgres as our primary database, but also store and serve some data from MongoDB and OpenSearch for specific use cases.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of some of the technologies you can expect to work with:\r\n\r\n* **Backend:** Ruby, Rails, Ruby GraphQL, Sidekiq, RSpec\r\n* **Frontend:** TypeScript, React, NextJS, Apollo GraphQL, Tailwind, Jest\r\n* **Database:** Postgres, MongoDB, OpenSearch, Redis\r\n* **Monitoring:** Sentry, PgAnalyze\r\n* **Hosting / CI:** Heroku, AWS, Vercel, Github Actions, Ubicloud\r\n\r\nDepending on your experience, you may work more on one side of the stack than the other, but as a small team that values learning and growth, there will be projects that may require you to work on parts of the stack that you\u2019re less familiar with (we hope this excites you)!\r\n\r\n### Compensation + Benefits\r\n\r\nFor this role, we offer a salary in the range of **$150,000 - $190,000** and equity. We also offer the following benefits to help you to do the best work of your career:\r\n\r\n* Flexible PTO (including 12 company holidays and 2 weeks of required PTO each year)\r\n* Medical, dental and vision coverage with HSA option; 50% coverage for dependents\r\n* Paid Parental Leave for primary and secondary caregivers\r\n* Your choice of premium tech setup \u2013\u00a0laptop, monitor, accessories, and headphones\r\n* $1,000 for your work-from-home setup\r\n* Stipend for co-working 1 day / week (e.g. WeWork)\r\n* Annual company retreat and/or team offsites",
